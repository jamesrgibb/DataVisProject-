    <h4 style="padding-left:10px">Story</h4>
    <p style="padding-left:10px">
        The visualization taught us a lot about football that were prior misconceptions. We initially thought that the data was going to tell  <br />
        us that defense is utterly more important than offense or that offensive turnovers are a direct correlation with losses. All of these  <br />
        things are important but we noticed that the teams that were the most successful, in terms of winning, were the teams that were ranked  <br />
        on average the highest in both offensive and defensive rankings. For example, in 2019 the LSU Tigers had one of the best teams ever in  <br />
        college football, the team #1st rankingoffense in the country and the #15th ranked defense. The opposite is also true for teams that are <br />
        very successful on offense or defense but not as much as on the other tend to still struggle to win games. The Texas Tech Red Raiders   <br />
        were an offensive powerhouse the same year ranking as the fourth best offensive team in the nation, however, they were ranked as 127th  <br />
        defensively that year. In 2019, Texas Tech won 4 games total. These two are a couple examples of balanced and lopsided teams, the balance  <br />
        LSU had on both side of the ball allowed them to win the National Championship that year and why they are considered one of the best teams ever.<br />
